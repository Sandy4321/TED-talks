An Investigation of Persuasiveness using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

__Abstract:__
A natural language processing project to reveal linguistic features that predict a persuasive TED Talk. I webscraped every TED Talk transcript and it's metadata from 2006 through 2017 and then used decision trees, random forest regressors, and linear regression to find key predictors of persuasive ratings by viewers. For professionals who need to communicate & influence others, TheodoreSpeaks.com is a data product to provide insights on how to speak to persuade.


__Results:__
I found that the change in negative and positive emotion words across the talk and the speaker’s use of key social pronouns like “I” and “we” made a big impact on persuasive ratings. My analyses resulted in a few important categories of words that make up a “linguistic signature” of persuasion and a classifier that you can use to predict the persuasiveness of your own text.

# Background & Motivation
Whether or not you ever give a TED Talk yourself, and no matter what your job title is - developer, data scientist, or recruiter - your job is ultimately to communicate and influence, so the words you say matter. Whether it's a morning stand up meeting, a training, or a conference call, you need to persuade and, sometimes, even inspire.

What better way to learn how to persuade and inspire than from the masters of persuasion - TED speakers?

I’m a TED Talks enthusiast - I’ve watched one a day for 3 years - and I noticed that some talks are persuasive— they change your day and maybe your life. Some others, fall flat and are completely forgettable.

Can we use the tools of natural language processing and statistical models to understand why some talks work - to see how persuaders persuade?


## The Problem
Your job, no matter the title, is to influence and persuade others. 

Can we use successful TED Talks to learn how to become more persuasive communicators?

## The Solution

For professionals who need to understand how to persuade and inspire, my product is takes data from TED.com uses natural language processing techniques and runs text through a series of data science models to provide insights on HOW to speak to be persuasive.	The product is called TheodoreSpeaks.com.
